## Location

I almost exclusively work remotely.  With family and other obligations onsite work is out of the question.

## Hours

I'm generally available for communication between 9a and 3p EST.  Evenings and weekends are for my family.

## Contract

I prefer to operate with a Master Services Agreement [MSA] that defines our working relationship and Statements of Work [SOW] as
addendums to the MSA for the tasks themeselves.

I'm happy to provide you with a copy of my MSA and a sample SOW, just send me an [email](mailto:jschoolcraft@aissaclabs.com).

## Communication

### Phone

I'm not a fan of the phone in general and tend not to answer if it's an inconvenient time or an unrecognized number.  I understand
that voice and video chats are much better at conveying meaning through tone and body language than email.  I just prefer calls to
be scheduled, have an agenda and, if necessary, have at least minimal written follow up to agree on the outcome of the call.

### Other ways

As we decide if we can work together [email](mailto:jschoolcraft@aissaclabs.com) is the best option.

Working together I prefer to use something a little more persistent and organized than email for task related conversations.  I can
likely adapt to whatever you're using internally.  If you don't have a system I'll suggest one.
