## Role

Lead Developer.  I was brought in to rescue the failing ruby API project.  Over the course of my involvement I sometimes hired additional developers
to help add bandwidth to the API project.

## Description

The [Trinexum](http://daxko.com/trinexum/) API was built as a way to expose [Trinexum](http://daxko.com/trinexum/) Data to a variety of endpoints.  The two primary endpoints where the web application that was being
rewritten in ASP.NET and a mobile app being developed in PhoneGap.

The Trinexum system is a series of systems designed to help YMCAs (and similar organizations) to handle everything:

- membership
- card access
- purchases
- course registration
- camp registration
- etc

## Task

Initially the task was to evaluate the existing code base and get the API ready for launch for a single YMCA.

After the API launched, enhancements and modifications included:

- Expanding the number of YMCAs that used the new systems
- Adding features so the web and mobile clients could gain parity with the previous web app
- scalability
- performance

## Tech

Sinatra, SQL Server, Nginx, Passenger, Varnish, Ansible.
