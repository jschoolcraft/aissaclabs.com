# Can I help you?

I've been writing software professionally since the turn of the century.  I'm "well seasoned".  I want to work on intersting
projects with cool people to make a difference.  Your project doesn't have to change the world or disrupt any markets, but
I'd much rather work on something that made someone's day better than not.

I might be able to help, if you:

- Have a frustrating business problem and you _know_ there has to be a better way.
- Had an iPhone, iPad or Rails app built for you.  While it was shiny at the time it could use a little TLC now.
- Need someone to build the backend for an iOS app you're having developed.
- Are thinking about moving from Rails to Phoenix.
- Need an iOS app.
- Want an iOS app.

I probably want to help, if you:

- can and will make a decision sooner rather than later given what we know at the time.
- work with me as a partner, be the business expert and let me be the tech expert.
- pay on time.
